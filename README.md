Works with Claude, Codex, Hermes, OpenClaw, or any plain LLM with shell
access.

## Get a job

```bash
npx @wonsukchoi/crondex recommend "warn me before my SSL cert expires"
npx @wonsukchoi/crondex show ssl-cert-expiry-check
npx @wonsukchoi/crondex deploy ssl-cert-expiry-check --var host=example.com
```

- `recommend "<what you want>"` — find the closest matching job (zero
  tokens, no network call, so an agent can check before writing one from
  scratch). Matching handles plurals, a small catalog-grounded synonym set
  (e.g. "notify"/"warn"/"remind" all match jobs tagged `reminder`), and
  falls back to fuzzy (edit-distance) matching on typos when nothing
  matches exactly.
- `list [--category x] [--tag y]` / `categories` — browse everything
- `show <id>` — print a job's full YAML
- `next <id> [--count n]` — print the next N run times for a job's schedule,
  in its declared timezone (zero tokens, no network call) — sanity-check a
  schedule before deploying it
- `add <id> [--dest path]` — copy it into your project to edit
- `init <id> [--category x]` — scaffold a brand-new job from the template
- `update <path> [--dry-run]` — re-pull a job you already `add`ed/`init`ed
  (matched by its `id` field) against the current catalog, print a diff of
  what changed, and overwrite it in place. `--dry-run` shows the diff
  without applying it.
- `deploy <id> --target <crontab|github-actions|systemd|docker|k8s-cronjob|eventbridge|cloud-scheduler> [--var name=value ...]`
  — turn a job into something that actually runs (crontab line, GitHub
  Actions workflow, systemd timer, Dockerfile, k8s CronJob, or a ready
  `aws`/`gcloud` command). `--var` overrides a variable's default. `hybrid`
  jobs deploy `command` by default; add `--mode prompt` for the prompt side.
- `deploy --list-installed` — show every crondex-managed line in your
  crontab (the ones left by `--install`)
- `uninstall <id>` — remove one of those installed crontab entries
- `doctor [--json]` — audit installed crontab entries against the catalog:
  orphaned entries, schedule drift, and version tagging/staleness. Exits `1`
  if any issues were found.
- `bundle <file.yaml> [--target <target>] [--dry-run] [--out-dir <path>] [--install]`
  — deploy every job in a manifest in one shot (see [Bundles](#bundles))

Add `--json` to `list`/`categories`/`show`/`recommend` for machine-readable
output — useful when an agent is parsing the result programmatically
instead of a human reading it.

No install needed — `npx` always runs against the latest catalog.

---

## Use as an MCP server

Skip the shell-out entirely — register crondex as an MCP server and your
agent gets `recommend`/`list`/`categories`/`show`/`next` as native tools
instead of invoking a CLI. Read-only: no filesystem writes, no crontab
access.

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add crondex -- npx -y @wonsukchoi/crondex mcp
```

Any other MCP client (e.g. `.mcp.json`, Claude Desktop's config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crondex": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@wonsukchoi/crondex", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Tools exposed: `crondex_recommend`, `crondex_list`, `crondex_categories`,
`crondex_show`, `crondex_next_runs` — each returns the same JSON shape as
the matching CLI command's `--json` flag.

Pass `--allow-deploy` (`crondex mcp --allow-deploy`, or add it to your MCP
client's args) to opt into one more tool: `crondex_deploy`. It takes the
same inputs as `crondex deploy` (`id`, `target`, `vars`, `mode`) and
returns the generated artifact text — a crontab line, workflow file,
systemd unit pair, etc. It's generation-only: it never writes a file,
never touches your crontab, and has no other side effect, so the server
stays safe to point an agent at even with `--allow-deploy` on. Without the
flag, `crondex_deploy` isn't registered at all.

## What's in a job

Every job is one YAML file:

```yaml
id: dependency-audit
version: 1
name: Dependency Vulnerability Audit
category: devops
schedule: "0 8 * * 1"    # standard 5-field cron
runner: hybrid            # shell | agent-prompt | hybrid
command: |                 # for runner: shell/hybrid
  ...raw shell audit, zero tokens...
prompt: |                  # for runner: agent-prompt/hybrid
  ...instructions with {{repo_path}}, LLM synthesizes+prioritizes...
script_note: what you lose by using `command` instead of `prompt`
variables:
  repo_path:
    default: "."
compatible_agents: [claude, codex, hermes, openclaw, generic]
```

- **`shell`** — runs `command` only. Zero LLM tokens, deterministic.
- **`agent-prompt`** — hands `prompt` to an LLM each run. Costs tokens, but
  can synthesize, prioritize, and draft prose.
- **`hybrid`** — ships both, pick per run: script to save tokens, prompt for
  more judgment. `script_note` explains the tradeoff.

`{{placeholders}}` resolve from `variables` — override them for your case,
then hand `command`/`prompt` plus `schedule` to whatever scheduler you have
(system crontab, a hosted cron, your agent's own scheduling mechanism). This
repo defines *what* to run and *when*, not the executor. Full field spec:
[`schema/job.schema.json`](schema/job.schema.json).

---

## Bundles

Deploy several jobs in one shot with a manifest file:

```yaml
# bundle.yaml
jobs:
  - id: ssl-cert-expiry-check
    vars:
      host: example.com
      port: "443"
  - id: dependency-audit
    vars:
      repo_path: /srv/app
  - id: cost-alert
    mode: prompt
```

```bash
crondex bundle bundle.yaml --target crontab --dry-run   # preview
crondex bundle bundle.yaml --target crontab --install   # install every job
crondex bundle bundle.yaml --target github-actions --out-dir .github/workflows
```

Each entry supports `id` (required), `vars` (variable overrides, same shape
as `deploy --var`), and `mode` (`script`/`prompt`, for `hybrid` jobs).
`--target crontab` (the default) combines every job into one crontab line
per job; every other target either writes one file (or file pair, for
`systemd`/`docker`) per job to `--out-dir`, or — without `--out-dir` —
prints all the artifacts concatenated with `===` header separators.
`--dry-run` previews the combined output without installing or writing
anything.

## Browse the catalog

The table below is regenerated by `npm run build-catalog`, so it never
drifts from what's actually in `jobs/`. For full details (description,
tags, variables) use `crondex list`, `crondex recommend`, or browse
`jobs/<category>/` directly.

## Contributing a job

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — copy `templates/job.template.yaml`
(or run `crondex init`), fill it in, `npm run validate && npm run
build-catalog`, open a PR. If you're touching JS in `bin/`, `lib/`,
`scripts/`, or `test/`, run `npm run format` and `npm run lint`
([Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)) — CI runs the same lint check. See
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for what's prioritized right now and what's
deliberately not built yet.
